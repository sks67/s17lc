# S17_LightCurve

This is a repository for the radio light curve program used in [Sarbadhicary et al 2017](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.464.2326S). **Please cite the paper if you use the code for your project**. 

The code is a simply Python script written with Python 2.7, although it should work with higher versions. 

###Installation
You can do the following :-
1. Clone this repository using `git clone` into your computer
2. Copy paste the `s17lc.py` into a blank `.py` file directly in your computer and use it accordingly.

###Usage
I have included a Jupyter notebook to show how to generate radius, velocity, and light curves with the code.
